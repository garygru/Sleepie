{"name":"Sleepie","tagline":"A minimal sleep timer for Mac OS X","body":"This is an easy to use sleep timer which sends your Mac to sleep when the time is over. It's a spin off from my Mac App Store App named [piZZa](http://itunes.apple.com/app/pizza/id412736166?mt=12) which features a countdown timer and a stop watch with plenty of options. For the sake of App Store Sandboxing the go-to-sleep part had to be stripped away and was separated into this app on GitHub. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"271\" alt=\"Sleepie\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1721790/10096962/f3bbf5fe-6375-11e5-87a4-377f7b028c06.png\">\r\n\r\nThere is a compiled binary available [here](https://github.com/garygru/Sleepie/releases/download/v1.0.1/Sleepie.app.zip).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
