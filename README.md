# Sleepie
A minimal sleep timer for Mac OS X

An easy to use sleep timer calling an Applescript which sends your Mac to sleep when the time is over.

It's a spin off from my Mac App Store App named [piZZa](http://itunes.apple.com/app/pizza/id412736166?mt=12) which features a countdown timer and a stop watch with plenty of options. For the sake of App Store Sandboxing the go-to-sleep part had to be stripped away and was separated into this app on GitHub. 
There is a compiled binary available [here](https://github.com/garygru/Sleepie/releases/download/v1.0.1/Sleepie.app.zip).
